Nuclide SDK PBR Example

Some users have requested this to be integrated into the
SDK as-is, however it's quite big!

So we created a separate repository for it.

This will get updated to include shaders for rtlight
and entity models soon.

To get started, either start a new game or enter
'map test_pbr' in console.

If you don't see reflections showing up, make sure
gl_specular is set to something higher than 0, then
issue 'vid_reload' in console.

All the assets in here are licensed CC0/Public Domain.

Installation:
Clone into the Nuclide SDK like so:

git clone https://www.github.com/VeraVisions/nuclide-pbr base_pbr
